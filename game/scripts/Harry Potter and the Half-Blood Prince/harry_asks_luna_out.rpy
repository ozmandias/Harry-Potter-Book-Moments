    "Harry asks Luna out for Professor Slughorn's Party"
    "It now seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the break would give them time to calm down, think better of their behavior..."
    "But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after enduring a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day."
    "They had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Transfiguration;"
    "Working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrows."
    "Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache;"
    "Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again."
    "She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind;"
    "Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron’s just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her."
    "He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bathroom on the floor below."
    "She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back."

    harry "No,"
    "said Harry firmly,"
    harry "that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then."
