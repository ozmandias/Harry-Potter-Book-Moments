    "Harry vs Draco - Duel in boys' bathroom"
    "More out of habit than anything, Harry made his usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Marauder’s Map as he went."
    "For a moment he could not find Malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy’s tiny, labeled dot standing in a boys’ bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle."
    "Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor."
    "The loud crash brought him out of his reverie;"
    "Hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below."
    "Outside the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door."
    "He could not hear anything."
    "He very quietly pushed the door open."
    "Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed."
    myrtle "Don’t"
    "crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of the cubicles."

    "And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot, that Malfoy was crying — actually crying — tears streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin."
    "Malfoy gasped and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder."

    "He staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand falling from his limp right hand."

    "gasped Harry."
    "Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest."
