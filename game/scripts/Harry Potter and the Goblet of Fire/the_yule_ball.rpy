    "The entrance hall was packed with students too, all milling around waiting for eight o’clock, when the doors to the Great Hall would be thrown open."
    "Those people who were meeting partners from different Houses were edging through the crowd trying to find one another."

    "Parvati found her sister, Padma, and led her over to Harry and Ron."
    padma "Hi,"
    "said Padma, who was looking just as pretty as Parvati in robes of bright turquoise."
    "She didn’t look too enthusiastic about having Ron as a partner, though; her dark eyes lingered on the frayed neck and sleeves of his dress robes as she looked him up and down."
    ron "Hi,"
    "said Ron, not looking at her, but staring around at the crowd."
    ron "Oh no …"
    "He bent his knees slightly to hide behind Harry,"

    "because Fleur Delacour was passing, looking stunning in robes of silver-gray satin, and accompanied by the Ravenclaw Quidditch captain, Roger Davies."
    "When they had disappeared, Ron stood straight again and stared over the heads of the crowd."

    "Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of black velvet with a high collar, which in Harry’s opinion made him look like a vicar."
    "Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink was clutching Malfoy’s arm."
    "Crabbe and Goyle were both wearing green; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, Harry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner."
    "The oak front doors opened, and everyone turned to look as the Durmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff."

    "Krum was at the front of the party, accompanied by a pretty girl in blue robes Harry didn’t know."
    "Over their heads he saw that an area of lawn right in front of the castle had been transformed into a sort of grotto full of fairy lights —"
    "meaning hundreds of actual living fairies were sitting in the rosebushes that had been conjured there, and fluttering over the statues of what seemed to be Father Christmas and his reindeer."

    "Professor McGonagall, who was wearing dress robes of red tartan and had arranged a rather ugly wreath of thistles around the brim of her hat, told them to wait on one side of the doors while everyone else went inside;"
    "they were to enter the Great Hall in procession when the rest of the students had sat down."

    "It was Hermione."
    "But she didn’t look like Hermione at all."
    "She had done something with her hair; it was no longer bushy but sleek and shiny, and twisted up into an elegant knot at the back of her head."
    "She was wearing robes made of a floaty, periwinkle-blue material, and she was holding herself differently, somehow — or maybe it was merely the absence of the twenty or so books she usually had slung over her back."
    "She was also smiling — rather nervously, it was true — but the reduction in the size of her front teeth was more noticeable than ever;"
    "Harry couldn’t understand how he hadn’t spotted it before."
    hermione "Hi, Harry!"
    "she said."
    hermione "Hi, Parvati!"
    "Parvati was gazing at Hermione in unflattering disbelief."

    "She wasn’t the only one either; when the doors to the Great Hall opened, Krum’s fan club from the library stalked past, throwing Hermione looks of deepest loathing."
    "Pansy Parkinson gaped at her as she walked by with Malfoy, and even he didn’t seem to be able to find an insult to throw at her."
    "Ron, however, walked right past Hermione without looking at her."
