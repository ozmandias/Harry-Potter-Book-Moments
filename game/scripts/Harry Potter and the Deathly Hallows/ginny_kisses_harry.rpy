    "taking Harry’s presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs."
    hermione "I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron —"
    "Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing."

    "Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room."
    "He had never been inside it before."
    "It was small, but bright."
    "There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on ne wall and a picture of Gwenog Jones,"
    "Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other."
    "A desk stood facing the open window,"
    "which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione,"
    "and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee."
    "The golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s window."
    "Ginny looked up into Harry’s face,"
    "took a deep breath,"
    "and said,"
    ginny "Happy seventeenth."

    "She was not tearful;"

    "Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold drain had entered the room when the door appeared, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble."
    "All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone."
    "He looked at Ginny wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her back on him."
    "He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears."
    "He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron."
    harry "I’ll see you later,"
    "he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom."
