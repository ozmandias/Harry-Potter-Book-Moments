    "Harry attacks Amycus Carrow with Crucio"
    "The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand."
    "Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor."
    "He let out a yell of fury and fear."
    amycus "What’ve they done, the little whelps?"
    "he screamed."
    amycus "I’ll Cruciate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it —"
    amycus "and what’s the Dark Lord going to say?"
    "he shrieked, standing over his sister and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist,"
    amycus "We haven’t got him, and they’ve gone and killed her!"

    mcgonagall "She’ll be perfectly all right."
    amycus "No she bludgering well won’t!"
    "bellowed Amycus."
    amycus "Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her!"
    amycus "She’s gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve got Potter!"

    mcgonagall "What do you mean, ‘got Potter’ ?"
    amycus "He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught him!"
    mcgonagall "Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!"
    "Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him."
    amycus "We was told he might come in here!"
    "said Carrow."

    amycus "Yeah, that’s what we’ll do."
    amycus "We’ll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there"
    "— he looked up at the starry ceiling toward the dormitories —"
    amycus "and we’ll say they forced her to press the Mark,"

    amycus "Couple of kids more or less, what’s the difference?"
    mcgonagall "Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and cowardice,"
    "said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale,"
    mcgonagall "a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate."

    "She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting she had found stuck to a lavatory seat."
    amycus "It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall."
    amycus "You time’s over."
    amycus "It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up or you’ll pay the price."
