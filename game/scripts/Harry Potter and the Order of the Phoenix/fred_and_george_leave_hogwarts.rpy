    umbridge "So!"
    "said Umbridge triumphantly, whom Harry realized was standing just a few stairs in front of him, once more looking down upon her prey."
    umbridge "So . . . you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp, do you?"
    fred "Pretty amusing, yeah"
    "said Fred, looking back up at her without the slightest sign of fear."
    "Filch elbowed his way closer to Umbridge, almost crying with happiness."
    filch "I’ve got the form, Headmistress,"
    "he said hoarsely, waving the piece of parchment Harry had just seen him take from her desk."
    filch "I’ve got the form and I’ve got the whips waiting. . . . Oh, let me do it now. . . ."
    umbridge "Very good, Filch,"
    "she said."
    umbridge "You two,"
    "she went on, gazing down at Fred and George,"
    umbridge "are about to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school."

    "Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left he ducked just in time — Fred and George’s broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor toward their owners."
    "They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor."

    "As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below."
    "Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd."
    fred "Give her hell from us, Peeves."
    "And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset."
